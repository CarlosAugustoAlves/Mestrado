# Probabilistic Planning

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries can be installed via `requirements.txt` if available.

## Usage

Run any of the probabilistic planning algorithms by executing the respective Python script. For example, to run the Policy Iteration algorithm:

```bash
python policy-iteration.py
```

You can modify the input parameters within each script to test with different datasets or configurations.

## Key Highlights

- **Policy Iteration**: Solves Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) by iteratively improving policies.
- **Value Iteration**: Computes the optimal policy by repeatedly updating value functions.
- **Prioritized Sweeping**: A more efficient algorithm that focuses updates on states likely to change.

## Datasets

Datasets for experiments are located in the `datasets/` directory. Update paths in the scripts to utilize the appropriate dataset for your experiments.
