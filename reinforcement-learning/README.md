# Reinforcement Learning

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Required libraries can be installed via `requirements.txt` if available.

## Usage

Run any of the reinforcement learning scripts by executing the respective Python script. For example, to run the Q-Learning implementation for the CartPole environment:

```bash
python cart-pole-Q-Learning.py
```

You can modify the input parameters within each script to test with different configurations or environments.

## Key Highlights

- **CartPole Q-Learning**: Implements Q-Learning to balance a pole on a cart.
- **CartPole REINFORCE**: Implements the REINFORCE algorithm for policy optimization in the CartPole environment.
- **Print Chart**: Utility script to visualize results and performance metrics.

## File Structure

- `src/cart-pole-Q-Learning.py`: Q-Learning implementation for CartPole.
- `src/cart-pole-REINFORCE.py`: REINFORCE algorithm implementation for CartPole.
- `src/print-chart.py`: Script for visualizing charts of training results.

## Notes

Ensure that the appropriate environment for the CartPole simulation is installed and accessible before running the scripts.
