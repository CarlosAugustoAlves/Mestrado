# MSc Artificial Intelligence Project

## Overview
This repository contains work related to my MSc in Artificial Intelligence. The project focuses on three key subjects:

1. **Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures**: Exploring efficient algorithms and data organization techniques to solve computational problems.
2. **Probabilistic Planning**: Investigating decision-making frameworks under uncertainty using probabilistic models.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Developing intelligent agents that learn optimal policies through interaction with their environment.

## Project Objectives
The primary goals of this project are:
- To analyze and optimize algorithms for problem-solving.
- To design probabilistic planning models for uncertain environments.
- To implement and evaluate reinforcement learning algorithms in various scenarios.

## Repository Structure
