# Algorithm Analysis and Data Structures

## Overview

This module contains implementations of key algorithms and data structures in Go (Golang). It focuses on sorting algorithms, heap data structures, and reusable utility functions, with corresponding test cases to ensure correctness and reliability.

## Key Highlights

### Sorting Algorithms
- **Counting Sort**: An efficient non-comparison-based sorting algorithm.
- **Quick Sort**: A fast, comparison-based divide-and-conquer sorting algorithm.
- **Radix Sort**: A non-comparison-based algorithm suitable for integer sorting.

### Heap
- Implementation of a binary heap data structure, useful for priority queue operations.

### Utility Functions
- Shared functions in `common.go` to streamline algorithm development.
